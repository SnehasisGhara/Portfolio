            Driven by a curiosity for innovation, I recently interned at Xenonstack, where I gained practical experience in software development methodologies, Linux environments, and DevOps practices. This internship has equipped me with valuable insights into the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) and agile methodologies.
